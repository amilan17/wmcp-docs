## **Recommendations**

1. **Develop Metadata quality KPIs, recommend, and implement a process for improving the quality of the metadata content**

Discovery effectiveness is highly dependent on metadata content. This is related not only to search effectiveness but also metadata content containing sufficient information for users to determine the suitability a a dataset for their purpose. In order to improve the quality content,

TT-MDG / TT-MDS will:

Define and prioritise a set of Key Performance indicators to be used to evaluate and monitor the quality of the WIS metadata content.

Ensure that suitable guidance and examples exist  (if appropriate, in exemplar metadata records), that quality assessment feedback can refer to.

Based on the KPIs, conduct a first evaluation (TT-MDG / TT-MDS)

Results shall be published and provided to ET-WIS; and TT-MDG / TT-MDS  shall liaise with ET-WIS for (where possible) integration of the quality content monitoring into the GISC Watch.

In addition, the defined KPIs shall be regularly reviewed, and as needed modified or new ones shall be developed.

Review the rubric content and see what can be supported in the future.

1. **Define and recommend best practices for implementing web discovery services.**

A set of discovery components and navigation elements based on the type of users, shall be described and recommended by TT-MDG / TT-MDS , to improve the &quot;search&quot; aspect of discovery services. A set of mockups shall be provided, to detail the type of navigation and discovery components that should be provided by the WIS catalogues.

- Use the TT-MDG / TT-MDS  working paper as a basis for providing recommendations and best practices on web discovery services
  =\&gt; **Organise Telco by end of March** for agreeing on the content of recommendations based on the initial proposals from the meeting paper.

- Potentially define KPIs for the discovery services.

1. **Recommend a separation between product collection and product instances in the catalogues.**

TT-MDG / TT-MDS shall explain the issues created by the different level of metadata granularity in the WIS Catalogues and recommend an approach to deliver separate discovery of and access to product collection metadata records, product instances records, and sub-selecting / access services.

The team will recommend a process for a user  to navigate seamlessly between each, so that if they access information about a subsetting service, they can easily choose to view the collection metadata, or subselect the relevant product instance metadata using the relevant aspects (right time step, right geographical, right elevation).
TT-MDG / TT-MDS  shall demonstrate that this two-step approach can be used to link data discovery and data access services, and data access services discovery.

Express the issue and impact on the discovery, highlight it in the catalogue, propose a solution and provide it to the expert teams.

1. **Explore and recommend on machine to machines interfaces and APIs**

TT-MDG / TT-MDS shall study and recommend machine to machine interfaces to be implemented by the different WIS catalogues for increasing their interoperability. A set of functionalities for the APIs shall be defined, and a machine to machine standard or protocol recommended to be implemented, depending on the function.

1. **Assess the suitability of, and timeline for migrating WMCP from ISO 19115 to ISO 19115-3**

TT-MDG / TT-MDS shall identify and highlight the benefits for migrating WMCP toward ISO 19115-3 and recommend a migration path from ISO 19115 to ISO 19115-3.

Examples of changes and additional information to be added shall be provided as necessary.

Support : TT-MDG / TT-MDS  will identify and assess available tools to support the migration (automatic translators, validators, â€¦.)

                                                                                                        **Priority : High**

1. **Mapping definition between WMCP and ** [**schema.org**](http://schema.org) ** dataset**

TT-MDG / TT-MDS shall develop a mapping between the information contained in the WCMP and the dataset fragments of [schema.org](http://schema.org). This shall allow WIS records and WIS catalogues to be better indexed by industry search engines.   This is expected to be achievable by June 2019

**7. Use Github for the WMCP**

Commence using github for activities, issue-tracking, and resource management

IPET-DD Report:   A18, A19, A23, D6, D15                    **Priority : High**

**8. Communication plan and provision of examples.**

TT-MDG / TT-MDS  will identify those communication gaps which might impact good metadata creation/revision; and propose / implement /review benefit / feasibility of solutions.  (Triage, discussionList, improved communication with trainers, etc)

** 9. Task list will be reviewed, and remaining task, as will be addressed**

Review tasklist.  Identify tasks which are linked to the quality assessment .. and develop guidance.  Prioritise   and assign  remaining tasks.
